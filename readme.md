## a program for dealing with the various ids and metadata associated with musical works, masters, pressings and records.

### The State of Things
- theres lots of different dbs, metadata classification systems, etc for music.
- I pick up a record. it's a 12" LP, "Carmen & L'Arlesienne Suites" by bizet, recorded by the new philharmonia orchestra with charles munch conducting. There's a lot of different pieces of metadata here:
1. The Physical Record. My copy of this release. I can hold it in my hand, it has a grading (mint, vg+, etc)
2. The Master Recording: An abstract "album" or "single" entity. It can include multiple pressings, including with variations in tracks.
3. The Pressing: The public release of a master recording, has a release date and country, catalog number, etc.
4. The Tracks
  - The Tracks: The Recordings = the recordings themselves, made by artist, engineer, producer, arranger.
  - The Tracks: The Works = the songs themselves made by composer, lyricist.
5. Various other credits at all levels
